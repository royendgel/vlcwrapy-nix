#vlcwrapy-nix

vlcwrapy-nix is a python script that once you set as nautilus script(drop them in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts), you can use HOME and END keys on keyboard to load prev and next files by closing old vlc process and starting new one.
Personally I use it with xmousebutton(http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/XMouseButtonControl.htm) to convert the extra keys on my CM Storm mouse to Home and End and then use them to load previous and next files on vlc. Very useful for binge watching multiple episodes of tvshows.
Dependency: pyHook https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyHook/



vlcwrapy-nix is a wrapper over vlc. It hooks into the keyboard and detects Home and End keys.
